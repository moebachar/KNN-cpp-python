# KNN Performance Comparison: C++ vs. Python

This repository contains implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in both C++ and Python, along with a comparison of their runtime performance.

## Introduction
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm widely used in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this repository, we provide implementations of KNN in both C++ and Python to explore the differences in runtime performance between the two languages.

## Files
- **main.cpp**: C++ implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- **main.py**: Python implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- **data.csv**: Sample datasets for testing the implementations.

## Usage
1. **C++ Implementation**: Compile `main.cpp` using your preferred C++ compiler.
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main.cpp
    ```
    Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

2. **Python Implementation**: Run `main.py` using Python.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Performance Comparison
We measure the runtime performance of both implementations using various datasets and report the results in the `performance_comparison.md` file.
